British Empire,26.35,412000000,#,The British Empire comprised the dominions colonies protectorates mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height it was the largest empire in history and for over a century was the foremost global power. By 1913 the British Empire held sway over 412 million people 23% of the world population at the time and by 1920 it covered 35500000 km2 (13700000 sq mi) 24% of the Earth's total land area. As a result its political legal linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power the phrase "the empire on which the sun never sets" was often used to describe the British Empire because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.
Mongol Empire,17.81,110000000,#,The Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries was the largest contiguous land empire in history. Originating in Mongolia the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe to the Sea of Japan extending northward into parts of the Arctic; eastward and southward into the Indian subcontinent Mainland Southeast Asia and the Iranian Plateau; and westward as far as the Levant and the Carpathian Mountains.The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of several nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan (c.  1162–1227) whom a council proclaimed as the ruler of all Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants who sent out invading armies in every direction. The vast transcontinental empire connected the East with the West the Pacific to the Mediterranean in an enforced Pax Mongolica allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade technologies commodities and ideologies across Eurasia.
Russian Empire,16.92,181000000,#,The Russian Empire was an empire that extended across Eurasia and North America from 1721 following the end of the Great Northern War until the Republic was proclaimed by the Provisional Government that took power after the February Revolution of 1917. The third-largest empire in history at its greatest extent stretching over three continents Europe Asia and North America the Russian Empire was surpassed in size only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 1812–1814 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe and expanded to the west and south.
French colonial empire,8.53,110000000,#,The French colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the "First French Colonial Empire" that existed until 1814 by which time most of it had been lost or sold and the "Second French Colonial Empire" which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. At its apex the Second French colonial empire was one of the largest empires in history. Including metropolitan France the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached 11500000 km2 (4400000 sq mi) in 1920 with a population of 110 million people in 1936.The main competition included Spain Portugal the Dutch United Provinces and England and later Great Britain and Russia. France began to establish colonies in North America the Caribbean and India in the 17th century but lost most of its conquests following its defeat in the Seven Years' War. The North American holdings were ceded to Britain and Spain but the later retroceded Louisiana (New France) back to France in 1800 . The territory was then sold to the United States in 1803 (Louisiana Purchase). France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850 concentrating chiefly in Africa as well as Indochina and the South Pacific. Republicans at first hostile to empire only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build its own colonial empire. As it developed the new French empire took on roles of trade with the motherland supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Rebuilding an empire rebuilt French prestige especially regarding international power and spreading the French language and the Catholic religion. It also provided manpower in the World Wars.
Umayyad Caliphate,8.24,62000000,#,The Umayyad Caliphate (661–750 CE;) was the second of the four major caliphates established after the death of Muhammad. The caliphate was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty (Arabic: ٱلْأُمَوِيُّون‎ al-ʾUmawīyūn or بَنُو أُمَيَّة Banū ʾUmayyah "Sons of Umayyah"). The third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644–656) was a member of the Umayyad clan. The family established dynastic hereditary rule with Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan long-time governor of al-Sham (Greater Syria) who became the sixth Caliph after the end of the First Muslim Civil War in 661. After Mu'awiyah's death in 680 conflicts over the succession resulted in a Second Civil War and power eventually fell into the hands of Marwan I from another branch of the clan. The region of Syria remained the Umayyads' main power base thereafter and Damascus was their capital.The Umayyads continued the Muslim conquests incorporating the Transoxiana Sindh the Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus) into the Muslim world. At its greatest extent the Umayyad Caliphate covered 15600000 km2 (6000000 sq mi) and 62 million people need quotation to verify making it one of the largest empires in history in both area and proportion of the world's population. The dynasty was eventually overthrown by a rebellion led by the Abbasids in 750. Survivors of the dynasty established themselves in Cordoba which in the form of an Emirate and then a Caliphate became a world centre of science medicine philosophy and invention ushering in the period of the Golden Age of Islam.
Empire of Japan,6.32,73000000,#,The Empire of Japan (Japanese: 大日本帝国 Hepburn: Dai Nippon Teikoku) was a historical nation-state along with their colonies protectorates mandates and other territories that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan.Japan's rapid industrialization and militarization under the slogan Fukoku Kyōhei (富国強兵 "Enrich the Country Strengthen her Armed Forces") and Shokusan Kōgyō (殖産興業 "Promote Industry") led to its emergence as a great power and the establishment of a colonial empire following the First Sino-Japanese War the Boxer Rebellion the Russo-Japanese War and World War I. Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism nationalism and totalitarianism eventually culminating in Japan's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II.
Han dynasty,4.82,57671400,#,The Han dynasty (Chinese: 漢朝; pinyin: Hàncháo) was the second imperial dynasty of China (202 BC–220 AD) preceded by the short-lived Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) and a warring interregnum known as the Chu-Han contention (206–202 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD). Spanning over four centuries the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day China's majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the "Han Chinese" and the Chinese script is referred to as "Han characters". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (202 BC–9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25–220 AD). The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) onward the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912 AD.
Soviet Union,4.3,293000000,#,The Soviet Union officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics[e] (USSR) was a federal socialist state in Northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics in practice its government and economy were highly centralized until its final years. It was a one-party state governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic the Russian SFSR. Other major urban centers were Leningrad Kiev Minsk Tashkent Alma-Ata and Novosibirsk. It was the largest country in the world by surface area spanning over 10000 kilometers (6200 mi) east to west across 11 time zones and over 7200 kilometers (4500 mi) north to south. Its territory included much of Eastern Europe as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia. It had five climate zones such as tundra taiga steppes desert and mountains. Its diverse population was collectively known as Soviet people.
Achaemenid Empire,4.08,112000000,#,The Achaemenid Empire ( Old Persian: 𐎧𐏁𐏂 romanized: Xšāça lit. 'The Empire') also called the First Persian Empire was an ancient Iranian empire based in Western Asia founded by Cyrus the Great. Ranging at its greatest extent from the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east it was larger than any previous empire in history spanning 5.5 million square kilometers (2.1 million square miles). Incorporating various peoples of different origins and faiths it is notable for its successful model of a centralised bureaucratic administration (through satraps under the King of Kings) for building infrastructure such as road systems and a postal system the use of an official language across its territories and the development of civil services and a large professional army. The empire's successes inspired similar systems in later empires.
Macedonian Empire,3.86,4760000,#,Macedonia ( (About this soundlisten); Ancient Greek: Μακεδονία Makedonía) also called Macedon (/ˈmæsɪdɒn/) was an ancient kingdom on the periphery of Archaic and Classical Greece and later the dominant state of Hellenistic Greece. The kingdom was founded and initially ruled by the royal Argead dynasty which was followed by the Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties. Home to the ancient Macedonians the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula and bordered by Epirus to the west Paeonia to the north Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south. Before the 4th century BC Macedonia was a small kingdom outside of the area dominated by the great city-states of Athens Sparta and Thebes and briefly subordinate to Achaemenid Persia. During the reign of the Argead king Philip II (359–336 BC) Macedonia subdued mainland Greece and the Thracian Odrysian kingdom through conquest and diplomacy. With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the sarissa pike Philip II defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. Philip II's son Alexander the Great leading a federation of Greek states accomplished his father's objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted. During Alexander's subsequent campaign of conquest he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River. For a brief period his empire was the most powerful in the world – the definitive Hellenistic state inaugurating the transition to a new period of Ancient Greek civilization. Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in philosophy engineering and science spread throughout much of the ancient world. Of particular importance were the contributions of Aristotle tutor to Alexander whose writings became a keystone of Western philosophy.
Ottoman Empire,3.86,14630000,#,The Ottoman Empire (/ˈɒtəmən/; Ottoman Turkish: دولت عليه عثمانيه‎ Devlet-i ʿAlīye-i ʿOsmānīye literally "The Sublime Ottoman State"; Modern Turkish: Osmanlı İmparatorluğu or Osmanlı Devleti; French: Empire ottoman) was a state and caliphate that controlled much of Southeastern Europe Western Asia and Northern Africa between the 14th and early 20th centuries. It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of Söğüt (modern-day Bilecik Province) by the Turkoman tribal leader Osman I. Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin it was Persianised in terms of language culture literature and habits. After 1354 the Ottomans crossed into Europe and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror.
Roman Empire,3.71,56800000,#,The Roman Empire (Latin: Imperium Romanum Classical Latin: [ɪmˈpɛri.ũː roːˈmaːnũː]; Koinē Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων romanized: Basileía tōn Rhōmaíōn) was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome. As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe Northern Africa and Western Asia ruled by emperors. From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and the city of Rome as sole capital (27 BC – 286 AD). Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis the empire was forcibly reassembled then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire (based in Milan and later in Ravenna) and over the Eastern Roman Empire (based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople). Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD when the imperial insignia were sent to Constantinople following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus. The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages.
Timurid Empire,3.27,0,images/MAP_RomanEmpire.png,The Timurid Empire (Persian: تیموریان‎ romanized: Timuriyān) self-designated as Gurkani (Persian: گورکانیان‎ romanized: Gurkāniyān lit. '"son-in-law" of Genghisids' ) was a Persianate Turco-Mongol empire comprising modern-day Uzbekistan Iran the southern Caucasus Mesopotamia Afghanistan much of Central Asia as well as parts of contemporary India Pakistan Syria and Turkey. The empire was founded by Timur (also known as Tamerlane) a warlord of Turco-Mongol lineage who established the empire between 1370 and his death in 1405. He envisioned himself as the great restorer of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan regarded himself as Genghis's heir and associated much with the Borjigin. Timur continued vigorous trade relations with Ming China and the Golden Horde with Chinese diplomats like Ma Huan and Chen Cheng regularly traveling west to Samarkand to collect tribute and sell goods continuing Mongol empire tradition. The empire led to the Timurid Renaissance particularly during the reign of astronomer and mathematician Ulugh Begh. In 1467 the ruling Timurid dynasty or Timurids lost most of Persia to Azerbaijanis and the Aq Qoyunlu confederation. But members of the Timurid dynasty continued to rule smaller states sometimes known as Timurid emirates in Central Asia and parts of India. In the 16th century Babur a Timurid prince from Ferghana (modern Uzbekistan) invaded Kabulistan (modern Afghanistan) and established a small kingdom there. Twenty years later he used this kingdom as a staging ground to invade India and establish the Mughal Empire.
Hunnic Empire,2.97,0,#,The history of the Huns spans the time from before their first secure recorded appearance in Europe around 370 AD to after the disintegration of their empire around 469. The Huns likely entered Europe shortly before 370 from Central Asia: they first conquered the Goths and the Alans pushing a number of tribes to seek refuge within the Roman Empire. In the following years the Huns conquered most of the Germanic and Scythian barbarian tribes outside of the borders of the Roman Empire. They also launched invasions of both the Asian provinces of Rome and the Sasanian Empire in 375. Under Uldin the first Hunnic ruler named in contemporary sources the Huns launched a first unsuccessful large-scale raid into the Eastern Roman Empire in Europe in 408. From the 420s the Huns were led by the brothers Octar and Ruga who both cooperated with and threatened the Romans. Upon Ruga's death in 435 his nephews Bleda and Attila became the new rulers of the Huns and launched a successful raid into the Eastern Roman Empire before making peace and securing an annual tribute and trading raids under the Treaty of Margus. Attila appears to have killed his brother and became sole ruler of the Huns in 445. He would go on to rule for the next eight years launching a devastating raid on the Eastern Roman Empire in 447 followed by an invasion of Gaul in 451. Attila is traditionally held to have been defeated in Gaul at the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields however some scholars hold the battle to have been a draw or Hunnic victory. The following year the Huns invaded Italy and encountered no serious resistance before turning back.
Seleucid Empire,2.89,30000000,#, The Seleucid Empire ( Ancient Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Σελευκιδῶν Basileía tōn Seleukidōn) was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; Seleucus I Nicator founded it following the division of the Macedonian Empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia (321 BC) and from there expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near-eastern territories. At the height of its power the Empire included central Anatolia Persia the Levant Mesopotamia and what is now Kuwait Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan. The Seleucid Empire became a major center of Hellenistic culture – it maintained the preeminence of Greek customs where a Greek political elite dominated mostly in the urban areas. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by immigration from Greece. Seleucid attempts to defeat their old enemy Ptolemaic Egypt were frustrated by Roman demands. Having come into conflict in the east (305 BC) with the Maurya Empire Seleucus I entered into an agreement with its ruler Chandragupta whereby he ceded vast territory west of the Indus including the Hindu Kush modern-day Afghanistan and the Balochistan province of Pakistan and offered his daughter in marriage to the Maurya Emperor to formalize the alliance.
Sasanian Empire,2.60,40000000,#,The Sasanian Empire or Sassanid Empire (/səˈsɑːniən səˈseɪniən/) officially known as the Empire of Iranians (Middle Persian: 𐭠𐭩𐭥𐭠𐭭𐭱𐭲𐭥𐭩 Ērānshahr) and called the Neo-Persian Empire by historians was the last Persian imperial dynasty before the arrival of Islam in the mid seventh century AD. Named after the House of Sasan it endured for over four centuries from 224 to 651 AD making it the longest-lived Persian dynasty. The Sasanian Empire succeeded the Parthian Empire and reestablished the Iranians as a superpower in late antiquity alongside its neighbouring arch-rival the Roman-Byzantine Empire.  The Sasanian Empire was founded by Ardashir I a local Iranian ruler who rose to power as Parthia weakened from internal strife and wars with Rome. After defeating the last Parthian shahanshah Artabanus IV in the battle of Hormozdgan in 224 he established the Sasanian dynasty and set out to restore the legacy of the Achaemenid Empire by expanding Iran's dominions. At its greatest extent the Sasanian Empire encompassed all of present-day Iran and Iraq and stretched from the eastern Mediterranean (including Anatolia and Egypt) to Pakistan and from parts of southern Arabia to the Caucasus and Central Asia. According to legend the vexilloid of the Empire was the Derafsh Kaviani.
Maurya Empire,3.71,60000000,#,The Maurya Empire was a geographically extensive Iron Age historical power based in Magadha and founded by Chandragupta Maurya which dominated the Indian subcontinent between 322 and 185 BCE. Comprising the majority of South Asia the Maurya Empire was centralized by the conquest of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and its capital city was located at Pataliputra (modern Patna). The empire was the largest political entity that has existed in the Indian subcontinent extending over 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles) at its zenith under Ashoka.  Chandragupta Maurya raised an army with the assistance of Chanakya author of Arthasastra and overthrew the Nanda Empire in c. 322 BCE. Chandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India by conquering the satraps left by Alexander the Great and by 317 BCE the empire had fully occupied northwestern India. The Mauryan Empire then defeated Seleucus I a diadochus and founder of the Seleucid Empire during the Seleucid–Mauryan war thus acquiring territory west of the Indus River.
Parthian Empire,2.08,35000000,#,The Parthian Empire ( 247 BC – 224 AD) also known as the Arsacid Empire was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran. Its latter name comes from its founder Arsaces I who led the Parni tribe in conquering the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast then a satrapy (province) under Andragoras in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I (r. c. 171–132 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates in what is now central-eastern Turkey to eastern Iran. The empire located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han dynasty of China became a center of trade and commerce.  The Parthians largely adopted the art architecture religious beliefs and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire which encompassed Persian Hellenistic and regional cultures. For about the first half of its existence the Arsacid court adopted elements of Greek culture though it eventually saw a gradual revival of Iranian traditions. The Arsacid rulers were titled the "King of Kings" as a claim to be the heirs to the Achaemenid Empire; indeed they accepted many local kings as vassals where the Achaemenids would have had centrally appointed albeit largely autonomous satraps. The court did appoint a small number of satraps largely outside Iran but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the Achaemenid potentates. With the expansion of Arsacid power the seat of central government shifted from Nisa to Ctesiphon along the Tigris (south of modern Baghdad Iraq) although several other sites also served as capitals.
Mali Empire,0.82,20000000,#,The Mali Empire (Manding: Nyeni or Niani; also historically referred to as the Manden Kurufaba sometimes shortened to Manden) was an empire in West Africa from c. 1235 to 1670. The empire was founded by Sundiata Keita (c. 1214 – c. 1255) and became renowned for the wealth of its rulers especially Musa Keita. The Manding languages were spoken in the empire. The Mali Empire was the largest empire in West Africa and profoundly influenced the culture of West Africa through the spread of its language laws and customs. Much of the recorded information about the Mali Empire comes from 14th-century North African Arab historian Ibn Khaldun 14th-century Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta and 16th-century Moroccan traveller Leo Africanus. The other major source of information is Mandinka oral tradition through storytellers known as griots.[7]  The empire began as a small Mandinka kingdom at the upper reaches of the Niger River centered around the town of Niani (the empire's namesake in Manding). During the 11th and 12th centuries it began to develop as an empire following the decline of the Ghana Empire to the north. During this period trade routes shifted southward to the savanna stimulating the growth of states such as Bonoman.[8] The early history of the Mali Empire (before the 13th century) is unclear as there are conflicting and imprecise accounts by both Arab chroniclers and oral traditionalists. Sundiata Keita is the first ruler for which there is accurate written information (through Ibn Khaldun). Sundiata Keita was a warrior-prince of the Keita dynasty who was called upon to free the Mali people from the rule of the king of the Sosso Empire Soumaoro Kanté. The conquest of Sosso in c. 1235 gave the Mali Empire access to the trans-Saharan trade routes.
Holy Roman Empire,0.74,20000000,#,The Holy Roman Empire (Latin: Sacrum Imperium Romanum; German: Heiliges Römisches Reich) occasionally but unofficially referred to as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in Western and Central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany though it also included the neighboring Kingdom of Bohemia and Kingdom of Italy plus numerous other territories and soon after the Kingdom of Burgundy was added. However while by the 15th century the Empire was still in theory composed of three major blocks – Italy Germany and Burgundy – in practice the links between these blocks had become so unsubstantial that only the Kingdom of Germany remained nearly all the Italian territories for instance having become in effect part of a narrowly-defined Habsburg dynastic patrimony unconnected to the Empire. The external borders of the Empire did not change noticeably from the Peace of Westphalia – which acknowledged the exclusion of Switzerland and the Northern Netherlands and the French protectorate over Alsace – to the dissolution of the Empire. By then it largely contained only German-speaking territories plus the Kingdom of Bohemia. At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 most of the Holy Roman Empire was included in the German Confederation.
Nazi Germany,0.61,90000000,#,Nazi Germany officially known as the German Reich until 1943 and Greater German Reich in 1943–45 was the German state between 1933 and 1945 when Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP) controlled the country which they transformed into a dictatorship. Under Hitler's rule Germany quickly became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The Third Reich[h] – meaning "Third Realm" or "Third Empire" – alluded to the Nazis' conceit that Nazi Germany was the successor to the earlier Holy Roman Empire (800–1806) and German Empire (1871–1918). The Third Reich which Hitler and the Nazis referred to as the Thousand Year Reich ended in May 1945 after just 12 years when the Allies defeated Germany ending World War II in Europe.
Aztec Empire,0.16,6000000,#,The Aztec Empire or the Triple Alliance (Classical Nahuatl: Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān) was an alliance of three Nahua altepetl city-states: Mexico-Tenochtitlan Texcoco and Tlacopan. These three city-states ruled the area in and around the Valley of Mexico from 1428 until the combined forces of the Spanish conquistadores and their native allies under Hernán Cortés defeated them in 1521.  The Triple Alliance was formed from the victorious factions of a civil war fought between the city of Azcapotzalco and its former tributary provinces. Despite the initial conception of the empire as an alliance of three self-governed city-states Tenochtitlan quickly became dominant militarily. By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519 the lands of the Alliance were effectively ruled from Tenochtitlan while the other partners in the alliance had taken subsidiary roles.
Zulu Empire,0.16,12000000,#,The Kingdom of Zulu sometimes referred to as the Zulu Empire or the Kingdom of Zululand was a monarchy in Southern Africa that extended along the coast of the Indian Ocean from the Tugela River in the south to Pongola River in the north. The kingdom grew to dominate much of what is today KwaZulu-Natal and Southern Africa. In 1879 the British Empire invaded beginning the Anglo-Zulu War. After an initial Zulu victory at the Battle of Isandlwana in January the British Army regrouped and defeated the Zulus in July during the Battle of Ulundi. The area was absorbed into the Colony of Natal and later became part of the Union of South Africa.
